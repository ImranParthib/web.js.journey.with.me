# Full-Stack JavaScript Roadmap (Open Learning)

## 1. Core JS/TS & Patterns (Foundation)

**Priority:** High

* Deepen JS: ES6+, closures, async/await, modules.
* TypeScript: types, interfaces, generics, utility types.
* Functional programming patterns in JS.
* Build small reusable functions or utility libraries.

## 2. Frontend Mastery

**Priority:** High → Medium

* **React/Next.js:** Hooks, SSR/SSG, API routes, component patterns.
* **State Management:**

  * Start with Context API (if not solid).
  * Move to **Zustand** for lightweight global state.
  * Redux only if app complexity demands it.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS advanced usage, responsive layouts.
* **Forms & Validation:** Use **Zod** + React Hook Form.
* **UI polish:** Animations (Framer Motion), transitions, micro-interactions.

## 3. Backend & Database

**Priority:** High

* **Node.js & Express:** REST APIs, middleware, authentication (JWT/Firebase/Clerk).
* **Database:**

  * MongoDB: CRUD, schema design, indexing, aggregation.
  * Optional: PostgreSQL basics if relational skills are needed.
* **Integration:** Connect backend APIs to frontend apps, handle errors, optimize queries.

## 4. Testing

**Priority:** Medium → High

* Unit testing: Jest (frontend), Mocha/Chai (backend).
* Integration testing: API endpoints, database flows.
* E2E testing: Playwright or Cypress for full app flows.

## 5. DevOps / Deployment

**Priority:** Medium → High

* **Docker:** Containerize frontend, backend, DB.
* **Docker Compose:** Multi-container setups for full-stack apps.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions/GitLab pipelines for automated build, test, deploy.
* **Hosting:** Vercel, Render, Railway, or AWS.

## 6. Full-Stack Projects

**Priority:** High

* Build real-world projects combining all above skills:

  * E-commerce app with auth, cart, checkout, payment.
  * Review platform: CRUD, admin moderation, discussion threads.
  * Personal portfolio/dashboard with CI/CD and testing.
* Use each project to layer in new skills—e.g., add Docker & CI/CD after basic app works.

## 7. DSA & OOP

**Priority:** Medium → High (for interviews)

* Solve targeted problems in arrays, strings, trees, graphs, DP on LeetCode/Codeforces.
* Apply **OOP principles in JS/TS**: modular classes, services, controllers, design patterns.
* Use full-stack projects as examples for OOP/system design in interviews.

## 8. Optional CP for Logical Agility

**Priority:** Low → Medium

* Only enough to train mental patterns, not to compete for medals.
* 1–2 problems/day, focusing on problem-solving patterns relevant to interviews.

## 9. Optional Extensions (Add-on Skills)

* **React Native:** Mobile apps with shared React skills.
* **Electron:** Desktop apps if cross-platform desktop experience is desired.
* **Golang:** High-performance backend or microservices, learn later if interested.
* **Other ecosystems (ASP.NET, Java, C++):** Only if career goals require them.

## Suggested Approach

1. Layered learning: Start with core JS/TS, then frontend mastery, backend basics, then move to testing & DevOps.
2. Project-based learning: Each skill you learn should immediately appear in a small project.
3. Iterative improvement: Add complexity step by step—state management → testing → Docker → CI/CD.
4. Interview readiness: Parallelly practice DSA and OOP in JS/TS, using projects as examples.
5. Optional skills: Add React Native, Electron, or Golang only after mastering main stack.
