# JavaScript Development Environment Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a JavaScript development environment on your machine.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is essential for running JavaScript outside the browser.

- Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.
- Follow the installation prompts to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is a popular IDE for JavaScript development.

- Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Run the downloaded installer to install VS Code on your machine.

## Step 3: Configure VS Code with Extensions (Optional)

Enhance your development experience by installing useful extensions.

1. Open VS Code.
2. Access the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Install the following recommended extensions:
   - **Live Server**: Launches a local development server with live reload feature.
   - **Prettier - Code formatter**: Automatically formats your code.
   - **ESLint**: Analyzes your code for potential errors and style issues.

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Ensure that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run `node -v` to check the Node.js installation.
- Run `npm -v` to verify npm is installed.

## Step 5: Create Your First JavaScript File

Start coding by creating a simple JavaScript file.

1. In VS Code, create a new file and save it with a `.js` extension, e.g., `hello.js`.
2. Write some JavaScript code, for example: `console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');`
3. Save the file.

## Step 6: Run Your JavaScript Code

Execute your JavaScript code using Node.js.

1. Open a terminal in VS Code (`Terminal -> New Terminal`).
2. Navigate to the directory containing your `hello.js` file.
3. Run the command `node hello.js`. You should see "Hello, JavaScript!" printed in the terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your JavaScript development environment and executed your first JavaScript program.
