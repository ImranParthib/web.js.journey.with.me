# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.

# DSA History

The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.
Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.

## Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** is about how data can be stored in different structures.
**Algorithms** is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

**Primitive Data Structures** are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

**Abstract Data Structures** are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

**DSA is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:**
