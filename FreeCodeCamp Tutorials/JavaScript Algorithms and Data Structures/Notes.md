# Core Knowledge

## JavaScript Primitive Data Types
- JavaScript has seven primitive data types.
- **String** is one of them. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned.
- The default value of an uninitialized variable is `undefined`.

## Arrays
- One of the most basic data structures in JavaScript is an **array**.
- Arrays are a non-primitive data type.
- Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.
- Arrays are special because they are considered **mutable**.
